# A json file with specific wide strings to test.
# The string wide used in Python are:
# 1, 2 or 4 Byte Wide.
##
# There is an extra kind, a Wide Char kind, but
# AFAIK the Wide Char is only used as representation on
# the C side of any Python/C API. So we don't test for it.

"strings" : {
	# Text on 1 Byte wide:
	1 : "'Hello friend!' translated to spanish: '¡Hola amigo!'",
	# Japanese text using 2 Byte wide unicode simbols
	2 : "'Hello friend!' translated to japanese: 'こんにちは！'",
	# Pi definition, uses 4 byte wide unicode simbols
