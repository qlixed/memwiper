# A json file with specific wide strings to test.
# The string wide used in Python are:
# 1, 2 or 4 Byte Wide.
##
# There is an extra kind, a Wide Char kind, but
# AFAIK the Wide Char is only used as representation on
# the C side of any Python/C API. So we don't test for it.

# Text on 1 Byte wide:
# Japanese text using 2 Byte wide unicode simbols
# Pi definition, uses 4 byte wide unicode simbols

# ByteWidth : Text
