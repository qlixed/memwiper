Installation:
=============

So far this is a dev code, so this instructions focus on the install from github
repo:

1) Clone the repo
2) Go to the memwiper dir and:

python setup.py install

That will fireup the compilation and installation procedure, don{t forget to use
sudo for a system-wide install.
However I recommend that you install this in a virtual env.
